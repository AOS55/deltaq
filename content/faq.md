### Why is this blog called ∇Q ?

A couple of reasons:
- I started out in aerospace and [max-Q](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_q) (∇Q=0) is the point where a spacecraft experiences the most force on departure and is key design parameter.
- My surname is **Q***uessy*.
- This blog is about answering **Q***uestions*.
